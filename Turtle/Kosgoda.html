<h1>Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h1>

<div class="p1">
  <p>
    Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii. Therefore they are also called chelonians by researchers and conservationists. 
    Chelonians are characterized by the special bony shell or carapace, which is developed from their ribs and acts as a shield. 
    They are an old group with the very first proto-turtles having evolved over 220 million years ago in the Triassic Era. The 
    order of Chelonii, also known as the Testudines, have three members in the group; turtles, tortoises, and terrapins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Turtles: In North America, the word indicates all chelonians, including tortoises and terrapins. However, in the UK, the turtle 
    indicates sea dwelling species of Chelonians. The word generally refers to chelonians with flippers that spend the major portion 
    of their lives in water.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tortoises: The word refers to land dwelling, non-swimming chelonians. They have legs and feet, as opposed to the flippers of the other members of the group.<br>
    Terrapin: Terrapin is a word referring to several species of small, edible, hard-shelled turtles that spend their lives in brackish water.

  <h1>The Threat to Sea Turtles and the Causes</h1>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>
    Of the 327 known species of chelonians alive as of today, many are endangered. There are seven species of sea turtles alive today. Of them, 
    six species are on the threatened or endangered list due to human actions or lifestyles. Some of the biggest threats that turtles face are:
  </p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Entanglement in fishing gear</li>
  <li>Poaching and illegal trade of eggs, meat, and shells</li>
  <li>Coastal development</li>
  <li>Plastic and other marine debris</li>
  <li>Global Warming</li>
</ul>

  <h1>The Kosgoda Turtle Care - Sri Lanka's Part in Turtle Conservation</h1>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>
    The Turtle Care Centre at Kosgoda beach is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The centre is located in the 
    South Western coastal village of Kosgoda and was established in 1981. It is also very popular as all five species of turtles that visit Sri 
    Lanka nest in Kosgoda. This is not so with many of the other hatcheries around the island whose beaches host only some of the species.
  </p>
  <p>
    The centre functions mainly as a hatchery and makes huge efforts to increase the rate of hatching and survival of baby turtles in their 
    very initial stages. However, the Care centre also works on sick or injured adults; treating them and releasing them back into the ocean. 
    They also run volunteer programs and awareness programs for local and international visitors.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="para">
  <h1>The Hatchery Works in the Following Steps:</h1>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  1. Staff patrols beach at nights looking for mother sea turtles that come out of the sea to lay eggs.<br>
  2. They protect the mother from afar during the nesting process, until she finishes laying the eggs and returns to the ocean.<br>
  3. The eggs are relocated from the beach to hatchery to protect them from predators and irresponsible human action.<br>
  4. In addition, fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they find to the hatchery.<br>
  5. The eggs develop and hatch in a protected area. This may take between 45-60 days.<br>
  6. The hatched turtles are released into the ocean on the same day if no complications arise. This is to avoid human interference in their lifestyles as much as possible.<br>
</div>

<div class="p2">
  <p>
    The Kosgoda Turtle Care Centre is a great place to learn and love nature while also having fun. It is hands-on and family-friendly and, therefore, should definitely be visited 
    on your holiday to Sri Lanka. Enjoy visiting the Kosgoda Turtle Care Centre as part of Lakpura's South Seas tour experience. Get a chance to see sea turtles of various species 
    in the different stages of their lives. Help feed the turtles or volunteer for a first-hand experience with these interesting creatures. Do your part in conservation by donating 
    for the needs of the turtles. Lakpura can assist you with one-day tours or even longer volunteering stays. We also provide you with safe transport and luxurious accommodation in 
    the vicinity.
