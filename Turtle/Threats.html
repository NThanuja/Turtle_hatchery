     <h1>Threats To Turtles</h1>
     <div class="p1">
       <p>
         Worldwide, six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened or endangered due to human actions and lifestyles. 
         From getting caught in fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs, there are lots of ways that these animals are affected by people.
         Sea turtles are built to last. Equipped with unique body armor to protect them from their natural enemies, they have 
         swum the seas since dinosaurs roamed the land. However, in recent history, rapidly increasing human populations have 
         resulted in new and acute pressures, making sea turtle survival ever more difficult.

     <h2>1.Harvest for Consumption</h2>
         <div class="p2">

            <p>
             Although sea turtles have spiritual or mythological importance in many cultures around the world, this has not prevented humans 
             from consuming their eggs or meat. In many coastal communities, especially in Central America and Asia, sea turtles are considered 
             a food source. During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches at night looking for nesting females. Often, they will wait until 
             the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. In some countries, sea turtle eggs are prized as 
             an aphrodisiac. Others customarily consume sea turtle meat in observance of religious holidays. For example, in Mexico, thousands of 
             inland residents journey to Pacific coastal communities during the week preceding Easter in search of sea turtles and other seafood. 
             During this short period of time, as many as 5,000 turtles are consumed in this region alone. Until the 1970s when sea turtles were 
             internationally recognized as endangered, their meat was also used to prepare turtle soup- considered a specialty by Europeans. 
             Additionally, people may use other parts of the turtle for products, including the oil, cartilage, skin and shell.

     <h2>2. Illegal Sea Turtle Shell Trade</h2>
         <div class="p2">
           <img src="./Images/hawksbill-products.webp" alt="">
           <div class="text-box">
            <p>
             Hawksbill sea turtles, recognized for their beautiful gold and brown shells, have been hunted for centuries to create jewelry and other 
             luxury items. As a result, these turtles are now listed as critically endangered. They are especially threatened in the Indian and Pacific 
             oceans and along the Caribbean Coast. According to recent studies, scientists estimate that hawksbill populations have declined by 90 percent
             during the past 100 years. To improve their survival outlook, an international agreement signed by 173 governments, known as CITES , declared 
             the trade of these shells illegal. However, the demand for shells continues today on the black market, especially in Japan. In Japan, the use
             of bekko (Japanese for hawksbill shell) dates back more than 300 years. Even today, bekko combs remain an important part of the traditional 
             Japanese wedding dress. This cultural importance contributed significantly to the international trade in bekko and resulted in the sharp decline 
             that occurred in the 20th century. Today, lack of information about sea turtles leads many tourists to unwittingly support the international trade 
             in these endangered species. Buying, selling or importing any sea any sea turtle products within the United States, as in many countries around 
             the world, is strictly prohibited by law, but turtle shell jewelry and souvenirs are still the most frequent contraband items seized by customs 
             officials from tourists returning from the Caribbean. While illegal sea turtle trade is primarily based on hawksbills, other sea turtle may be 
             killed for their skin to make leather goods. Beauty products are also be illegal if they contain sea turtle oil.

         <h2>3. Oil Spills</h2>
         <div class="p2">
           <img src="./Images/oil-covered-turtle.webp" alt="">
           <div class="text-box">
            <p>
             Oil spills from exploration for and transportation of oil and gas, as well as from urban and agricultural run-off, pose substantial risks to marine turtles 
             and to the habitats they rely upon. Oil from spills and leaks that sit on the surface of the water doesn't really stick to sea turtles like it would to other 
             marine species. But oil can get in their eyes, on their skin, and in their lungs when they come to the surface to breathe. Although turtles maybe the toughest 
             in terms of resisting some of the immediate physical damage from oil spills, they have proved to be more vulnerable to chemical exposure that happens indirectly 
             through the food they eat. Not only do larger spills pose a problem for the turtles, studies have shown that continuous exposure over time will weaken a sea turtle's
             overall health, making it more susceptible to other dangers.

         <h2>4. Direct Take</h2>
         <div class="p2">
           <img src="./Images/PlasticBagMikeNelsonEPA.jpg" alt="" >
           <div class="text-box">
            <p>
             Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean (UNESCO Facts & Figures on Marine Pollution). 
             Currently, it is estimated that there are 100 million tons of plastic in oceans around the world. It is expected that another 60 billion pounds will be produced this year alone. In some 
             areas, the buildup of plastics is estimated to span 5 million square miles. To put it into perspective, that is the equivalent of the area of the U.S. plus India. How does that much plastic 
             get there? Eighty percent of the plastic debris comes from land. It washes out to sea from our beaches, streets and highways. It flows out through storm drains into streams and rivers. It flies
             away from landfills and into the stomachs of sea turtles everywhere. Most of the debris is recognizable. Plastic bags, bottles, balloons, degraded buoys, packaging materials and food wrappers 
             all contribute to the debris. While large plastics are a substantial pollutant, over time these plastics will break down into smaller, more toxic pieces. Not only are these small plastics more
             easily ingested, but they also act as hosts for invasive species, carrying them to other regions of the ocean exponentially increasing the damages caused by plastics. In addition, certain plastic 
             contains toxic additives that are distributed into the water and enter into the food chain.

         <h2>5. Climate Change</h2>
         <div class="p2">
           <img src="./Images/IYORBank_CoralBleaching_TheOceanAgency_30.webp" alt="">
           <div class="text-box">
            <p>
               We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the 
               natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of 
               extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.An increase in nesting beach temperatures 
               will also have an impact on sea turtles. Because sea turtles are reptiles, they rely on the temperature of the sand 
               in which the eggs incubate to determine the gender of the hatchling in a nest. Typically, the eggs in the lower, cooler, 
               part of the nest will become males, while the eggs in the upper, warmer, part of the nest will become females. With 
               increasing nest temperatures, scientists predict that there will be more female than male hatchlings, creating a significant 
               threat to genetic diversity. Warmer ocean temperatures are also likely to negatively impact food resources for sea turtles, 
               and virtually all marine species. Coral reefs, which are an important food source for sea turtles, are in great danger. 
               Almost half of the coral reef ecosystems in the U.S. are in poor or fair condition. As a result of rising temperatures, 
               coral reefs are suffering from a “bleaching” effect that kills off parts of the reef.
