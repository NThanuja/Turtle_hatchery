    <h1>Bentota Turtle Hatchery</h1>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>
            Not only is Sri Lanka surrounded by pristine beaches and scenic views, we're blessed with the luxury of having a wide variety of sea 
            creatures finding their home in our waters. Therefore, it is indeed our duty to make our land a homely place for these creatures and ensure their safety.
            Sri Lanka is one of the world's major biodiversity hotspots, and a chief concern for the island is the conservation of its wildlife. 
            The turtle hatcheries that you find dotted along the western coastline tackle the issue by investing in the survival of Sri Lanka's turtles.
        </p>

    <h2>The Importance</h2>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>
            Left on their own, turtle eggs are susceptible and defenceless against predators; there is also a danger of the eggs being found by local 
            fishermen and sold to poachers, who in turn sell them on the black market. The hatcheries combat this by buying the eggs from the fishermen 
            at a higher price, encouraging them to keep bringing in the endangered eggs to a safer location.
            Definitely not an easy task but conservation of turtle nesting grounds is vital for their successful breeding. 
            These efforts include keeping the beach clean, planting shelter plants and etc.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conservation Effort</h2>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>
            Once at the hatchery, the eggs are kept safely buried in sand until they emerge from their shells, when they are moved and placed into tanks 
            for the first few days of their lives. This gives them to opportunity to grow stronger before they are released back to the dangers of the sea, 
            increasing their odds of survival. Several species of turtles are saved in this way.
            Large part of the work of the hatchery includes collecting eggs from nests on the beach and reburying them in the hatchery where they can hatch 
            in safety. Later these hatchlings are released back to their habitat.The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is highly involved in creating awareness among 
            the tourists and the local community of the importance of conserving these endangered species. They do so by community activities and awareness 
            campaigns through which a wealth of information can be gathered.

        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>What You Can Experience</h2>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>
            At sunset, you can witness the baby turtles being set free on the beach and watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are asked to be 
            mindful of the process of returning baby turtles to the sea. Loud noises are not allowed, nor are bright lights and flash photography; the baby turtles 
            can confuse the lights for the moon over the ocean, which hinders them from being able to return home.While you're on your Bentota sightseeing tour, 
            do make a stop at the Hatchery to witness some of the world's rarest sea turtle species. You can purchase your entry ticket at the entrance for a 
            price of Rs. 500 and catch a glimpse of the five sea turtle species that have been declared as endangered.
